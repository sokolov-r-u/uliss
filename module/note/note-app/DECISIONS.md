# Architecture decisions: note-service

Append-only log of architecture decisions. Newest at the end; a reversed decision gets a new entry that names the
one it replaces. Format: see the repository `CLAUDE.md` ("Architecture decisions").

## 2026-10-14 — Outbox claims are fenced by a lease id

- **Decision:** every claim counts as an attempt and issues a new `leaseId`; `complete`/`recordFailure` apply only
  while the lease still matches. An expired claim that used the last attempt is failed (with its terminal handler)
  instead of being handed out again. Leases derive from the OpenAI SDK settings (`spring.ai.openai.*`).
- **Consequences:** domain writes made by a handler are not fenced; a handler must check the domain state itself.
- **Source:** commits `0903875`, `5cb5ec4`.

## 2026-10-15 — An instance claims only event types it can handle

- **Context:** with attempts counted per claim, an instance without a handler for a type (rolling deploy) burned the
  attempts of that type's events until they failed.
- **Decision:** `OutboxService.claim()` filters by the types of the registered `OutboxHandler`s (injected with
  `@Lazy` to break the OutboxService → service → handler → OutboxService cycle).
- **Source:** commit `578468f`.

## 2026-10-15 — Assistant replies without text are not history

- **Decision:** one predicate, `ChatMessageEntity.isEmptyAssistantReply()` (assistant role, blank content), removes
  such replies from the provider chat history and from the summary retrieval query. The summary prompt itself still
  sees every message with its status.
- **Source:** commits `f1de74d`, `55da254`.

## 2026-10-14 — The note status stream is bounded

- **Decision:** the stream sends SSE comment heartbeats and closes after 10 minutes; the SPA re-reads the note and
  reconnects while it is generating (`module/web/DECISIONS.md`).
- **Source:** commits `bbfc872`, `77a398b`.
